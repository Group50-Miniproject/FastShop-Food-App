<h2> DOCUMENTATION </h2>
This is an online food application that University 
of Ghana can use to order meals. The purpose of this application 
is to reduce the waiting time of making orders for food.
It is built for mobile phones, tablet and laptops.

This application is <b> responsive</b>. Users can login and sign up
to create an account on the platform.<br>
